I wrote it multiple years ago, around 2021-2022, before I became a professional software developer. It was very enlightening (and amusing) to read this so many years later. So, I decided to release this after making some redaction adjustments. I also added some retrospective notes about things I find interesting now, so many years later.\nTake this as a \"Professional programmer reads through his old student FP notes\" blog. I hope you find it useful or amusing in any way!\n\nA few months ago, I heard about a programming language named Haskell, which was said to be purely functional. I didn't know much about functional programming at the time, so learning that a language is completely functional caught my attention.\nSince that day, I started learning Haskell through videos and exercises. The journey was so interesting that I decided to document my experience in this article. Some chapters consist of my personal understanding mechanisms of Haskell's fundamental concepts, while others are about my opinion of specific topics. Needless to say, this journal is subjective and I made it mainly to to consolidate my learning. I hope the reader finds this useful in any way :) .\nI want to say thanks to James Hobson for making his Haskell tutorial series, which I used as my main learning resource throughout this journey.\n0. Prelude\nSo I'm going to start out by telling you a bit about myself. As at the time of writing, I am a self-taught hobbyist developer in the process of becoming a professional self-taught developer, whatever that (\"professional\") means (*note: this was written around 2021-2022). Right now, I mostly use Python (Django) and Typescript, but I've also used most other popular languages, like C, C++ and Java. Also, I plan on investing a lot of time to learn Rust, as I've had a really good time using it.\nBefore starting to learn Haskell, I had very little experience and knowledge about functional programming. To be honest, I didn't even understand what imperative programming really meant! I did know about some of the features of functional programming, though, like anonymous functions and immutability.\nSo, why did I start learning Haskell? Well, a company I was interested in working at was hiring Haskell/functional programmers (which seemed weird to me, as Haskell is not even in the top 10 most in-demand languages). So, I decided to take on the challenge, and that led me to Youtube, where there were a lot of talks about how functional programming makes systems more stable and reliable. After watching some of those FP introductory talks, I decided it was time to get my hands dirty with some programming.\n1. Setup\nThe first video on Hobson's Haskell-tutorial series is about downloading and setting up the tools to work with Haskell. These include Cabal and GHC. So I went to Haskell's website and downloaded GHCup, which, in turn, installed Cabal, GHC and Stack. This reminded me of Rustup, the official Rust toolchain installer,  so I was really happy that a similar tool existed for Haskell.\nAt first, I tried to use Stack because of its \"isolated GHC\" feature (similar to virtual envs for Python), but it was kind of weird and decided to stick with Cabal.\nAs recommended by Hobson, I typed cabal v2-repl to open the interactive mode, which is really nice and useful. At first, I was kind off annoyed to type v2 before every Cabal command, but after a quick look at cabal --help, I noticed I can just use cabal repl for development and cabal v2-repl when I needed some back-compatibility features.\nAfter this, the next step was configuring my favorite editor, NeoVim, to work with Haskell. I use coc.nvim as my auto-completion/IntelliSense plugin, so I was expecting to find a coc.nvim Haskell plugin or something similar that I could install easily with the :CocInstall command. Unfortunately, that was not the case. After searching in the coc.nvim docs, I found a config sample that I could easily copy and paste into my coc-settings.json file. After doing that, autocompletion and formatting were working like a charm.\nWith my environment ready, I dove into what makes Haskell special: everything is a function!\n2. Functions, functions and more functions\nA function, in a mathematical sense, is a relationship that maps a value from a set A to a value from a set B. According to this definition, values from A must have only one value from B associated to them, so each time you apply the function on the same value, you get the same result (determinism).\nThis notion of function is equally applied to Haskell functions, with the special feature that Haskell functions only take one parameter. This was the first weird thing that I had to understand about Haskell.\n\nretrospective note: In reality, Haskell functions are not really deterministic. The point I was trying to make here is that functions calculate their result using the parameters they are given, as opposed to being able to access state in an effectful manner (e.g. global variables).\n\nSo, let's take a simple multiply function written in C:\n\nIf we wanted to write a double function, using our previous multiply function, we could do:\n\nMakes sense, right? Now, let's do the same in Haskell:\n\nIt looks right, and it works! We have a (seemingly) pure two-parameter multiply function. But, remember what I said about Haskell functions: they all take one parameter only; so, what is going on here? Well, it turns out that the C multiply function is a function that maps two ints to another int, but the Haskell multiply function is a function that maps an Int to a function that maps an (I didn't make a mistake there) Int to another Int. The type signature looks like Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int (you can check any function's type signature using the :t [function] command from Cabal's REPL). What does this imply? Well, whereas in C, if you try to call multiply like multiply(2), you get an error for not sending the right amount of parameters (2); in Haskell, however, you just get another function. So, just like that, you can define your double function as follows:\n\nSo, comparing our two Haskell double functions, double a = multiply 2 a and double = multiply 2, we notice the the former is redundant. And this is something that happened to me a lot in the following days, because I usually tried to use typical non-functional patterns that could be simplified using functional patterns. Thankfully, Haskell's language server is very good at detecting these redundancies and pointing them out, which greatly helped in my learning process.\n\nretrospective note: Currying completely amazed me when I first learned it, as you can see from my writing. It soon became one of my favorite techniques to make my code more expressive and elegant.\n\n3. Side observations\nHere are some other observations up to this point that I couldn't fit in the previous sections.\n\nLists were really easy to grasp. In a sense, I found Haskell lists like a sort-of merge between C arrays and Python lists, in the way that they are homogeneous (every element must have the same type) but of variable length. Also, there are list comprehensions, really similar to Python's.\nPattern matching is a really nice feature that allows to change a function's behavior depending on some boolean value. It also was easy to grasp, as it's similar to Rust's match and the new Python pattern matching feature..\n\n\nretrospective note: I think it's interesting how I missed the \"strangest\" feature of Haskell's lists: they' linked lists!\n\n4. Recursion\nI decided to take a whole chapter on the topic of recursion, as it's one of the parts I most struggled with in Haskell.\nRecursion means defining a function in terms of itself. Quite a simple definition. When I first started learning programming it was a bit hard to understand, but then it became pretty intuitive. In most cases, I've learned to avoid recursion if possible, trying to convert recursive solutions to iterative ones. This is because common programming languages have a maximum recursion depth, which limits the amount of recursion you can do. Also, recursion is slower in some languages and iteration often \"feels more natural\" to write in imperative languages.\nIn Haskell, however, you don't have iteration. There are no while or for statements which you can use as naturally do in other languages. You only have recursion. And this is one of the most difficult things to grasp in Haskell and functional languages, as you might so used to imperative iterations that it is really hard to think about recursive solutions.\nBut this is also one of the things I love about Haskell! It makes you think in ways you are not used to, which often leads to solutions that are more elegant and \"fun\", that you wouldn't have thought of when using imperative languages. And, recursion is really optimized in functional-programming languages, so you don't have to worry about the limitations I mentioned before.\n5. Weird classes: Foldable, Functors, Monads, Monoids...\nNow we get to an event stranger topic i(and even more fun!). Haskell, being a \"mathematical\" language, tries to abstract common programming elements/patterns into \"classes\" (typeclasses, not OOP classes) that you can \"instantiate\". This is also really difficult to understand at first, as these often have mathematical names and descriptions. Thankfully, the more basic (and elemental) classes are quite easy to understand, once you get over the vocabulary. I'll write my personal explanation of my favorite of the basic typeclasses next: Monoid and Monad.\nMonoid\nAccording to Hackage:\n\nA type&nbsp;a&nbsp;is a&nbsp;Monoid&nbsp;if it provides an associative function (&lt;&gt;) that lets you combine any two values of type&nbsp;a&nbsp;into one, and a neutral element (mempty) such that:\na &lt;&gt; mempty == mempty &lt;&gt; a == a\nA&nbsp;Monoid&nbsp;is a&nbsp;Semigroup&nbsp;with the added requirement of a neutral element. Thus any&nbsp;Monoid&nbsp;is a&nbsp;Semigroup, but not the other way around.\n\nOkay, so that explains it pretty well if you ignore the whole \"Semigroup\" part. But true understanding comes from practical application. For that purpose, let's derive our own Monoid using Int and the sum function (+).\nInts can be Monoids\nFrom the description above, we get that we need two things: an \"associative function\" and a \"neutral element\". Let's suppose our associative function is an Int sum. You will notice that the neutral element of sum is 0, because if we add 0 to a number, we get the same number: a + 0 = 0 + a = a. That's exactly what is described in the Monoid definition! (a &lt;&gt; mempty == mempty &lt;&gt; a == a) So, that means we can define an Int as a Monoid whose neutral element is 0:\n\nThis will give us an error, as Int must be an instance of Semigroup first (Semigroups are just Monoids without the neutral element). So let's define that:\n\nThat's it! Now, if we run (5 :: Int) &lt;&gt; (3 :: Int), it will return 8, meaning we just defined a Monoid instance for Int.\nIf we wanted to do this with multiplication, we would set 1 as the neutral element (mempty).\nHaskell is based upon these kinds of \"abstracions\" through typeclasses, making code simpler, more \"generic\", and elegant. A more practical example of how Monoids (and typeclasses in general) can be useful is in Tsoding's video \"How Monoids are useful in Programming?\". Just another example of how beautiful functional-programming is.\nSo, what even are Monads?\nMonads are perhaps the strangest concept in functional programming. In fact, I've noticed there's a recurring joke that states \"Monads cannot be explained\". Going back to the definition of Monoid in Hackage, we can say it was pretty self-explanatory even if you're not too used to mathematical language. By contrast, here is the definition for Monad in Hackage:\n\nThe&nbsp;Monad&nbsp;class defines the basic operations over a&nbsp;monad, a concept from a branch of mathematics known as&nbsp;category theory. From the perspective of a Haskell programmer, however, it is best to think of a monad as an&nbsp;abstract datatype&nbsp;of actions. Haskell's&nbsp;do&nbsp;expressions provide a convenient syntax for writing monadic expressions.\nInstances of Monad should saisfy the following:\n...\n\nFrom that snippet you can see how even Hackage doesn't bother trying to explain Monads. But this shouldn't be an issue in the long run, as, from what I've seen in some forums, you will eventually get used to Monads, even if you can't define them or explain them properly. So don't get discouraged if you don't understand Monads at first, as it is something most Haskell programmers have gone through.\n\nretrospective note: On Hackage, Monads are defined purely through their behavior (functions), which makes them a bit \"cryptic\". However, since I wrote that paragraph, I learned a lot of useful analogies and metaphors that bring Monads back to the \"real world\". It's more a question of vocabulary and the \"succintness\" of some of the official documentation.\n\n\nAt this point I got bored of writing and left the journal unfinished (^_^;).\n\nRetrospective\nReading this so many years after makes me notice how many things I take for granted nowadays. Say, the language setup section is a bit funny to me now, as I'm so used to installing and uninstalling languages that this is more of an afterthought.\nRecursiveness has also become much more intuitive to me now. In fact, I now lean to recursive solutions most of the time, when I'm not constrained by performance or stack sizes.\nYou can also note, from my writing, the \"awe\" I felt when talking about the basic typeclasses. I understood them more in a \"mathematical sense\", just trying to ignore what I didn't understand and go along until I got to do it. And, now, I can happily say it worked! Through a lot of reading and learning from multiple sources, I now understand the basic typeclasses not only as simple \"mathematical definitions\", but as useful metaphors and analogies that help make code more reusable and elegant.\nIn conclusion, it was very fun and insightful looking back to the past to see my learning process, especially of this paradigm that I truly feel completely changed the way I write code and see programming in general. It also leaves me as a lesson to write more often so I can do more exercises like this in the future :) .\nIf you are starting your own FP journey, I encourage you to embrace the confusion and keep trying and learning until things start to \"click\". And why not keep a journal too? You might thank yourself later ;)\nWell, congrats on getting to the end of the article! Thank you for reading, I hope it was fun and somewhat productive! Keep learning!\n","id":"https://neolight1010.github.io/blog/haskell-journal/","title":"My first Haskell experience"},"https://neolight1010.github.io/blog/node-ts-setup/":{"body":"Ideally, I would just use Deno for every new Typescript project I create. But sometimes you just have to use Node.\nThese are the tools and libraries I use to make my Node + Typescript experience less cumbersome.\nFeel free to check out the final template on this repository, based on what is written on this post.\nES Modules\nES Modules are the standard for modern-Javscript module resolution, and they are growing in popularity with each new package and framework out there. So, I adhere to this new standard by prefering ES-Module libraries and setting my target module resolution to ES Modules. Look at this article for more information on the benefits of ES Modules over CommonJS.\n@tsconfig/strictest\nTo enjoy the full benefits of static typing, I use the tsconfig.json template from @ts-config/strictest. It enables the strictest Typescript configurations in a sensible manner. You can either extend it by installing the package, or just copy the configuration file directly.\nBiome\nIt's always been bothersome to me having to set up mulitple tools for formatting, linting and import-sorting. Thankfully, this is not necessary anymore thanks to Biome. This tool packs a formatter, linter and import-sorter in a single, easy-to-configure and Typescript-friendly package. Goodbye Prettier and ESLint!\nHusky + lint-staged\nI've tried multiple tools for Git hooks over the years, but I always end up coming back to Husky. I think it is the best Git-hook solution in the Node ecosystem due to its flexibility and simplicity of use.\nIn order to set up a pre-commit hook for automatically formatting and linting the code, I pair up Husky with lint-staged. This tool runs your hooks in a smart way to avoid messing up your Git workspace -- that is, you don't have to worry about unstaged modifications inadvertedly being added to new commits. That's very handy to keep your commits tidy!\nVitest\nEvery time I've had to configure Jest with Typescript I've ended up with a headache. Vitest not only runs tests faster, but its integration with Typescript is seamless! It's also part of the Vite (best build tool?) ecosystem and it allows you to configure more advanced features in a breeze, like path aliases. Oh, and about that...\ntsc-alias\nI usually find that, in larger projects, relative imports become distracting and fail to express the designed module structure. Typescript's path aliases help you overcome this issue easily by allowing you to create \"shortcuts\" to your modules and libraries. However, Typescript does not resolve these aliases after compilation, so we need another tool to correctly reference the actual code during build or runtime.\ntsconfig-paths is the most popular of these tools, but the resolution is performed at runtime, which I think produces unnecessary overhead. [tsc-alias], although less popular, is my preferred tool, as it performs the resolution at compile time; you just need to add a new command to your build script and you're ready to go!\nThe default alias I recommend you add is \"@/*\": \"[./src/*]\". That way, you can easily import your main modules like: import { NavBar } from \"@/components/index.js\" or import { zip } from \"@/utils/index.js\".\nAdditionally\nThese are some additional tools/libraries that I find useful for my projects:\nfp-ts\nThis library allows you to write code in a functional style. It packs very useful utilities like the Option, Either and Task types. The code you write with this library will end up looking very different to your traditional imperative code, but if you use it right, it will be more concise, expressive, safe and reusable. Just make sure your team is okay with adopting this paradigm!\nI might write a blog about this beautiful library sometime. Stay tuned!\nVite\nVite has become one of the most popular build tools out there. It's fast, modern, easy to use and featureful. I highly recommend it to build new frontend projects. You can pair up Vite with Vitest for the best Typescript-for-frontend experience out there.\nYarn\nWith time, NPM has caught up with the features of its competitors. But Yarn still holds up well against it thanks to its parallel-installation process and its easy adoptability. I highly recommend it as a middle ground between regular NPM and the more \"experimental\" package managers like pnpm.\nThank you!\nThank you for reading this blog! I hope you found it useful :)\n","id":"https://neolight1010.github.io/blog/node-ts-setup/","title":"My perfect Node + Typescript setup"}},"docInfo":{"https://neolight1010.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://neolight1010.github.io/about/":{"body":16,"title":0},"https://neolight1010.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://neolight1010.github.io/blog/haskell-journal/":{"body":1331,"title":3},"https://neolight1010.github.io/blog/node-ts-setup/":{"body":432,"title":4}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
